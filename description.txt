Once all of your students have forked the galvanize-eats repo, they will need to go to settings for their
fork (ie: https://github.com/ctide/galvanize-eats/settings) and check the box in front of issues to enable those.

You'll need to modify the script to include your own personal token, and to include the github usernames of all of your students
as well.

$ brew install ruby
$ gem install httparty -v 0.13.7
